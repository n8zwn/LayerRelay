LayerRelay is licensed as a combined work under the GNU Affero General
Public License, version 3 or any later version (`AGPL-3.0-or-later`). The full

## AI-assisted development

Development of this project has included substantial assistance from AI coding
tools, including OpenAI Codex and Anthropic Claude. That assistance has included
implementation, refactoring, tests, documentation, and release-preparation work.

The maintainer decides what is accepted into the repository and is responsible
for reviewing, testing, and verifying the provenance of accepted changes. This
disclosure is informational: it does not change the project's
`AGPL-3.0-or-later` license or any third-party rights and notices below. An AI
disclosure is not a substitute for documenting the source and license of copied,
adapted, generated, or vendored material.

## OpenPrintTag Material Database data

The optional filament picker refreshes generated public material and brand
snapshots from the
[`OpenPrintTag Material Database`](https://database.openprinttag.org/), whose
source is maintained in the
[`OpenPrintTag/openprinttag-database`](https://github.com/OpenPrintTag/openprinttag-database)
repository. OpenPrintTag is an open-source initiative by Prusa Research, and
the database is community-driven.

LayerRelay keeps only bounded FFF identity and display fields plus a six-digit
primary RGB colour when the source colour is fully opaque. It does not cache
upstream photos, package details, purchase links, or material properties.
LayerRelay searches its normalized local snapshot synchronously. Picker text is
not included in requests to OpenPrintTag or persisted in
`openprinttag-materials-v1.json`. The snapshot may be stale, incomplete, or
unavailable and is never required for manual tool configuration. Upstream data
is normalized into LayerRelay's existing tool-slot shape. No endorsement by
Prusa Research or OpenPrintTag is implied.

The upstream database is distributed under the MIT License:

## Prusa libbgcode provenance

`bgcode.js` is a JavaScript/Node.js adaptation of parts of
[`prusa3d/libbgcode`](https://github.com/prusa3d/libbgcode), including the
binary G-code specification, Heatshrink decoding behavior, and
`MeatPack::unbinarize` behavior. It entered this codebase on 2026-07-04 and has
since been modified for JavaScript buffer handling, error handling, and this
application's metadata needs.

The provenance audit compared the local port with immutable upstream revision
[`6f4ad7ce6b0e638b760199d6611039a610a5a479`](https://github.com/prusa3d/libbgcode/tree/6f4ad7ce6b0e638b760199d6611039a610a5a479),
in particular:

- [`doc/specifications.md`](https://github.com/prusa3d/libbgcode/blob/6f4ad7ce6b0e638b760199d6611039a610a5a479/doc/specifications.md)
- [`src/LibBGCode/binarize/meatpack.cpp`](https://github.com/prusa3d/libbgcode/blob/6f4ad7ce6b0e638b760199d6611039a610a5a479/src/LibBGCode/binarize/meatpack.cpp)
- [`src/LibBGCode/binarize/meatpack.hpp`](https://github.com/prusa3d/libbgcode/blob/6f4ad7ce6b0e638b760199d6611039a610a5a479/src/LibBGCode/binarize/meatpack.hpp)

That upstream revision is distributed under GNU AGPL version 3 or later.

## MeatPack — BSD 3-Clause notice

libbgcode identifies its MeatPack implementation as an adaptation of Scott
Mudge's MeatPack work. The local JavaScript decoder follows that implementation
through libbgcode. Source audited at

## heatshrink — ISC notice

libbgcode credits Scott Vokes' heatshrink implementation. The local decoder's
early history does not establish whether it was independently implemented from
the format or adapted from that implementation, so this notice is retained
conservatively. Source audited at
